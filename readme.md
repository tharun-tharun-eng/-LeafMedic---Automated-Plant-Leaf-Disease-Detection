# 🌿 LeafMedic - Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection

LeafMedic is a Streamlit web application that allows users to detect plant leaf diseases from uploaded images using deep learning. It enhances input images, runs predictions with a trained CNN model, and generates a detailed disease diagnosis report with visual charts.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv tf-env
   # Windows
   .\tf-env\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source tf-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Upload a leaf image.
2. Preprocess with OpenCV: resize → grayscale → histogram equalization → Gaussian blur → unsharp masking.
3. Spot Detection: Otsu thresholding + contour bounding boxes.
4. Predict: CNN (MobileNetV2 backbone) outputs softmax probabilities.
5. Visualize: Show top-5 chart and confidence metric.
6. Report: Generate downloadable text report with description & treatment.
